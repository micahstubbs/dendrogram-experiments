an iteration that draws a smaller dataset.

If your tree dataset is small, then this example should be useful for showing how your dataset might look as a dendrogram.

D3â€™s [cluster layout](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#cluster) produces node-link diagrams with leaf nodes at equal depth. These are less compact than [tidy trees](/@d3/tidy-tree), but are useful for dendrograms, hierarchical clustering and [phylogenetic trees](/@mbostock/tree-of-life). See also the [radial variant](/@d3/radial-dendrogram).`
